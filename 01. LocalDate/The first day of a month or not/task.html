  <p>We are used to talking about days in relation to their position in a month, for example, February 22. But as we've already mentioned, there's another way to address a day: to give an order number to each day in a year. Then we could say, for example, "53rd day of the year".</p>
  <p>Write a program that reads a year and the order number of a day, and checks if this day is the first day of a month or not.</p>
  <p>The program must output either "<strong>true"</strong> or "<strong>false"</strong>.</p>
  <div>
   <p><strong> Sample Input 1: </strong></p>
   <pre>2017 31</pre>
   <p><strong> Sample Output 1: </strong></p>
   <pre>false</pre>
  </div>
